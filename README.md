"We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. 
People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. 
The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do." -Cypherpunk Manifesto.
